  - Temporal graph: 23 episodic nodes, 191 entity nodes
  - Relationships: 589 MENTIONS + 555 RELATES_TO edges
  - Workaround: RediSearch operator sanitization applied
  - Provenance: Entry IDs embedded in episode names
  - All validation fixes: timestamp fail-fast, body snippet fallback, group_id partitioning
```

```

**Total Code:** ~1,250 lines across 5 backend files
**Total Tests:** 45 tests (38 contract + 7 smoke)

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Pluggable Architecture**
   - Protocol-based contract (not inheritance)
   - Runtime type checking with @runtime_checkable
   - Versioned canonical payloads
   - Graceful import failure handling

2. **Two Production Adapters**
   - **LeanRAG**: Entity extraction, hierarchical clustering, subprocess-based
   - **Graphiti**: Episodic memory, temporal graphs, library-based with async wrapping

3. **Robust Exception Handling**
   - BackendError (base)
   - ConfigError (configuration issues)
   - TransientError (retryable failures like database timeouts)

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Contract validation (38 tests)
   - Null backend for API testing
   - Smoke tests with real databases
   - Performance targets (<90s)

### Technical Achievements

1. **Async-to-Sync Bridging**
   - Graphiti uses async API (add_episode, search)
   - Contract requires sync methods
   - Solution: asyncio.run() wrapper pattern
   - Maintains clean sync interface

2. **Subprocess Execution Model**
   - LeanRAG adapter calls Python scripts via subprocess
   - Proper error propagation and timeout handling
   - Working directory management

3. **FalkorDB Integration**
   - Both backends target FalkorDB on port 6379
   - LeanRAG: Uses subprocess calls to LeanRAG scripts
   - Graphiti: Uses FalkorDriver (not Neo4j driver)
   - Shared database instance for unified testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Complete Phase 3)
1. Set up test environment:
   ```bash
   # Option A: Install as packages (recommended)
   pip install 'watercooler-cloud[memory]'

   # Option B: Development with submodules
   pip install -e external/LeanRAG
   pip install -e 'external/graphiti[falkordb]'

   # Start FalkorDB
   docker run -p 6379:6379 -p 3000:3000 -it --rm falkordb/falkordb:latest

   # Configure LLM (OpenAI or local)
   export LLM_API_KEY="sk-..."  # or "local" for Ollama
   export LLM_API_BASE="http://localhost:11434/v1"  # for Ollama
   ```

2. Run full test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_backend_smoke.py -v
   ```

3. Validate performance and optimize if needed

### Short Term (Phase 4)
1. Complete documentation updates
2. Add usage examples
3. Final code review
4. Update project README

### Future Enhancements
1. Watercooler-specific chunking preset
2. LeanRAG query result structuring
3. Additional backend adapters (if needed)
4. Performance benchmarking suite
5. CI/CD pipeline integration
