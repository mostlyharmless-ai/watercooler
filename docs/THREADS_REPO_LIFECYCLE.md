# Threads Repository Lifecycle

This document captures the authoritative lifecycle for pairing a code repository
with its sibling `<repo>-threads` repository, covering every combination of
local/remote state, branch publication, and auto-provisioning.

## Terminology
- **Code repo** - the git repository containing application code.
- **Threads repo** - the companion git repository (named `<repo>-threads`).
- **Local clone** - the on-disk checkout used by the MCP server or CLI.
- **Remote** - the upstream git hosting service (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
- **Published branch** - a code branch with an upstream tracking ref
  (`branch@{upstream}` exists). When the code branch is published, the
  threads branch must sync with the remote; otherwise entries stay local until
  the code branch is promoted.

## Repository Bootstrap Matrix

| Remote threads repo | Local clone present | Auto-provision | Action sequence |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Accessible          | Yes                 | _N/A_          | Reuse existing checkout; configure git user. |
| Accessible          | No                  | _N/A_          | `git clone` -> configure git user. |
| Missing             | Yes                 | `0` / unset    | Keep local repo; operate in local-only mode (no pushes). |
| Missing             | No                  | `0` / unset    | `git init` -> add `origin` remote for later promotion. |
| Missing             | No                  | `1`            | Run `WATERCOOLER_THREADS_CREATE_CMD` -> reattempt clone. |
| Unreachable         | any                 | any            | Abort operation; surface `GitPullError`/`GitPushError` so the caller can retry once connectivity returns. |

Notes:
- Auto-provisioning is enabled by default; set
  `WATERCOOLER_THREADS_AUTO_PROVISION=0` to disable it.
- Auto-provisioning only triggers for SSH remotes in dynamic contexts (no
  explicit `WATERCOOLER_DIR`).
- When provisioning succeeds, the clone is retried immediately. If the repo is
  still unavailable, we fall back to local init but record the provisioning
  output for diagnostics.
- "Unreachable" includes network failures, sandbox denials, or authentication
  errors. These are fatal for published branches because we must never advance
  the conversation without first syncing with the remote state.

## Branch Instantiation & Sync States

| Code branch state        | Threads branch state                | Expected behaviour |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Not published (no upstream) | Branch missing locally & remotely    | Create local branch (`git checkout -b`). No remote pull/push. |
| Not published            | Branch already local                | Reuse local branch, skip remote interaction. |
| Published, remote branch present | Local branch missing            | `git checkout -b <branch>` then set upstream (`git push -u origin <branch>`). |
| Published, remote branch present | Local branch present without upstream | `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch>` and pull. |
| Published, remote branch missing | Local branch present            | Create branch locally; first push will promote it when remote becomes available. |

The MCP server automatically handles branch alignment when
`WATERCOOLER_AUTO_BRANCH` is enabled (default). This creates the branch
if needed, keeps the working copy on the correct branch, and configures tracking
when the remote is available.

## Operation Sequences

Watercooler supports two synchronization modes that share the same safety
guarantees. Synchronous mode performs all git operations inline (legacy
behaviour). Async mode records commits locally and lets a background worker pull
and push in batches. Async mode is the default on Windows and can be enabled
everywhere via `WATERCOOLER_ASYNC_SYNC=1`.

### Common groundwork
1. Resolve code context and threads directory.
2. Instantiate or reuse the git sync manager. If the local checkout was removed,
   the threads repo is re-cloned (or re-initialised).
3. Perform repository bootstrap as described earlier (provisioning, init,
   remote detection).
4. Ensure the threads branch matches the code branch. When the
   remote branch already exists, it is fetched and upstream tracking is set so
   the local branch is aligned with the remote tip before new commits are
   recorded.

### Synchronous mode (legacy)
1. Pull latest (`git pull --rebase --autostash`). Failure raises `GitPullError`.
2. Execute the operation (append entry, status update, etc.).
3. Stage, commit, and push with retry. Network/auth failures
   raise `GitPushError`; concurrent pushes trigger pull + retry up to three
   times before failing.
4. Local-only branches stop after the commit; once the branch is published the
   next write will push the backlog automatically.

### Async mode
1. Execute the operation immediately -- no blocking pull.
2. Stage and commit locally. Each entry still maps to a single
   git commit with the canonical footer block.
3. Enqueue the commit for the async worker. The queue persists to
   `.watercooler-pending-sync/queue.jsonl`.
4. The worker runs continuously:
   - Performs a background pull every `WATERCOOLER_SYNC_INTERVAL` seconds to keep
     read operations fresh without blocking the caller.
   - Pulls with rebase before pushing (preserves conflict guarantees) when local
     commits are queued.
   - Pushes all queued commits in a single operation.
   - Retries with exponential backoff on network failures.
5. Priority operations trigger an immediate flush (ball hand-offs, `say` calls,
   `set_status(..., CLOSED)`). Other writes flush on the 5-second batch window,
   when 50 commits are queued, or after a 30-second ceiling.
6. `flush_now` / `watercooler sync --now` forces an immediate push, and
   `list_threads` surfaces a marker for entries awaiting sync.
7. `list_threads` and `read_thread` return immediately using the cached view,
   annotating the output with the last refresh age and pending local updates.

### Post-write accounting
- Every commit records the standard footer block (`Watercooler-Entry-ID`,
  `Watercooler-Topic`, `Code-*`, `Spec`).
- Async mode logs auto-merges as system entries whenever the worker replays
  concurrent commits.
- Errors captured during async flush (pull/push) bubble up as `GitPushError`
  when a priority flush is requested so agents can react immediately.

## Async Configuration

Environment variables controlling async behaviour:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `WATERCOOLER_ASYNC_SYNC` | auto (`1` on Windows, `0` elsewhere) | Force async (`1`) or synchronous (`0`) mode. |
| `WATERCOOLER_BATCH_WINDOW` | `5` seconds | Soft delay before batching commits. |
| `WATERCOOLER_MAX_BATCH_DELAY` | `30` seconds | Hard ceiling; worker flushes even if retries are pending. |
| `WATERCOOLER_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` | `50` commits | Flush once this many pending commits accumulate. |
| `WATERCOOLER_MAX_SYNC_RETRIES` | `5` | Push retry attempts per flush cycle. |
| `WATERCOOLER_MAX_BACKOFF` | `300` seconds | Maximum backoff delay after repeated failures. |
| `WATERCOOLER_SYNC_INTERVAL` | `30` seconds | Background pull cadence that keeps reads fresh. |
| `WATERCOOLER_STALE_THRESHOLD` | `60` seconds | Age after which `list_threads` marks the cache as stale. |

Queue files live next to the threads repo (`.watercooler-pending-sync/`). Each
line stores the commit metadata plus a checksum so the worker can resume safely
after crashes. Removing the directory is safe -- the next write will re-create it.

## Failure Modes & Recovery

| Failure | Detection | Response |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Network/auth failure reaching remote | `git ls-remote` or `git push` fails | Abort with `GitPullError`/`GitPushError`. User re-runs after restoring connectivity. |
| Remote branch deleted upstream | `git pull` reports "could not find remote ref" | Treat as non-fatal; continue locally until remote branch is recreated. |
| Rebase conflict | `git pull --rebase` exits 1 | Abort, run `git rebase --abort`, then investigate conflict manually before retrying. |
| Provisioning misconfigured | Provision command exits non-zero | Raise `GitSyncError` during bootstrap with captured stderr. |

## Appendix: Why Not Unify Code and Threads Repos?

Watercooler intentionally maintains a sibling repository (`<repo>-threads`)
rather than colocating collaboration history inside the code repository.

**Reasons:**
- **Signal preservation** - application commits stay focused on code while
  threads capture high-frequency planning and hand-offs without polluting the
  code history.
- **Operational isolation** - thread commits avoid triggering CI/CD pipelines,
  and the async queue can push independently of application deploys.
- **Access control** - collaboration logs often have different retention or
  sharing requirements than code; separate repos make policy enforcement easier.
- **Branch pairing semantics** - the "intentional sharing" contract (local
  branches stay local, published branches push) is clearer when collaboration
  history lives in a peer repo.

Alternatives considered:
- **Unified repo (`.watercooler/threads/` subdirectory)** - reduces git traffic
  but clutters code history and entangles CI pipelines.
- **Git notes** - keeps history clean but hides context behind tooling that most
  developers and hosted platforms don't surface.

Given these constraints the sibling-pattern remains the most predictable option,
and the async sync path removes the primary performance pain for Windows
without changing the repository contract.
